        <p class="introduction">Welcome to Inferno,
          On this page you can find everything about the map like: callouts, smokes, nades, flashes, positioning, common enemy spots and holding angles.
        </p>
        <img class="map" src="inferno_map.jpg">
        <p class="introduction2">
          In the image above you can see all callouts in the map. The most important ones to remember are: these on A and B side.
          Now let's take a closer look at both sides.  
          </p>

      <p class="image_text">In this map you can see different colored dots.
        All of them are positions of the CT players. 
        Red dots represent the CT players holding positions that are standing on the ground.
        Green dots represent the CT players holding positions that are standing on a box, platform or sth else.
        After T reveals their positions on A site players from Mid and B site arae going to rotate to A site and hold the blue dots angles.

              Three players are going to hold this site:one is going to hold mid from short, another player is going to hold mid frmo long and the third person is going to hold apartments. 
              Their goal is to win time and kill one or two enemy players while their teammates are rotating without letting the Ts capture the site.

            <p>
               First strategy contains pushing to the side.
               One player goes apartments, four players go Mid and rush to A.
               This strategy isn't fast clearing so expect some people from B to rush you from behind.

        The B bomb site is known for its tight corners and close-quarter engagements.
         The B site itself is a small area surrounded by walls, with a fountain in the middle.
         Banana is the main entry point, but you can also come from CT and Construction if map control is gained.

              Two players are going to hold this site: Both of them are goindg to hold Banana.
           Their goal is to win time and kill one or two enemy players while their teammates are rotating without letting the Ts capture the site.
             </p></td>
          <td><h2>T strategy</h2>
            <p>
              First strategy contains pushing to the side.
              Five player rush thrugh Banana.
              The idea of this strategy is quickly rushing to site. If you repeat this strategy, be prepared to have grenades and Molotov's thrown at you
              In this process a few teammates may die but the main idea is that the Ts are rushing to site so fast that the rest of the CTs that are on A and Mid don't have enough time to react to rotate to A.
              If the Ts manage to take over the site they plant the bomb and now they just have to defend it.
              The second strategy contains slowly killing the enemy team.

    Mid is a central area of Inferno, connects to A bombsite and provides critical map control for both teams.
            It consists of several key positions such as Window, Underpass, Ladder, and Connector.
            Controlling the mid-area is essential to have the most information and to be able to attack from more angles.
