        <p class="introduction">Welcome to Vertigo,
          Mirage features two bombsites, A and B, separated by a spacious mid-area, offering numerous tactical approaches.
        </p>
        <img class="map" src="vertigo_map.jpg">
        <p class="introduction2">
          In the image above you can see all callouts in the map. The most important ones to remember are: these on A and B side.
          Now let's take a closer look at both sides.

      <p class="image_text">In this map you can see different colored dots.
        All of them are positions of the CT players. 
        Red dots represent the CT players holding positions that are standing on the ground.
        Green dots represent the CT players holding positions that are standing on a box, platform or sth else.
        After T reveals their positions on A site players from Mid and B site arae going to rotate to A site and hold the blue dots angles.

              Two players are going to hold this site:one is going to hold ramp and the second is going to hold palace.

            <p class="A_text">
               First strategy contains pushing to the side.
               One player goes palace, one players goes Mid and the rest of the team goes ramp.
               The idea of this strategy is quickly rushing to site.
               In this process a few teammates may die but the main idea is that the Ts are rushing to site so fast that the rest of the CTs that are on B and mid don't have enough time to react to rotate to A.
               If the Ts manage to take over the site they plant the bomb and now they just have to defend it.
               The second strategy contains slowly killing the enemy team.

        B site Mirage features a more enclosed space, with limited entry points for terrorists. 
        The main access routes for T-side include B Apartments and Short B. 
        Due to the site's layout, B site often requires one-two people.

    Mid is a central area of Mirage, connecting both bombsites and providing critical map control for both teams.
            It consists of several key positions such as Window, Underpass, Ladder, and Connector.
            Controlling the mid-area is essential to have the most information and to be able to attack from more angles.
