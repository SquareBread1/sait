        <p class="introduction">Welcome to Dust2,
          Dust2 features two bombsites, A and B, separated by a spacious mid-area, offering numerous tactical approaches.
        </p>
        <img class="map" src="dust2_map.jpg">
        <p class="introduction">
          In the image above you can see all callouts in the map. The most important ones to remember are: these on A and B side.
          Now let's take a closer look at both sides.

      <p class="image_text">In this map you can see different colored dots.
        All of them are positions of the CT players. 
        Red dots represent the CT players holding positions that are standing on the ground.
        Green dots represent the CT players holding positions that are standing on a box, platform or sth else.
        After T reveals their positions on A site players from Mid and B site arae going to rotate to A site and hold the blue dots angles.

            <p>
              Two players are going to hold this site: both of them are going to hold Long.
              Their goal is to win time and kill one or two enemy players while their teammates are rotating without letting the Ts capture the site.
             </p></td>
          <td><h2>T strategy</h2>
            <p>
               This strategy contains pushing to the side.
               All players rush Long using all of their smokes and flashbangs.
               The idea is to quickly get control of A site before the rest of the CTs come.
            </p></td>

        The B bomb site is known for its tight corners and close-quarter engagements.
         The B site itself has lots of boxes in the middle which offer great close quarters combat.
         Upper tunnels is the main entry point, but you can also come from Mid-area if map control is gained.

          <td><h2>T strategy</h2>
            <p>
              First strategy contains pushing to the side.
              Five player rush thrugh Upper tunnels.
              The idea of this strategy is quickly rushing to site.
              In this process a few teammates may die but the main idea is that the Ts are rushing to site so fast that the rest of the CTs that are on A and Mid don't have enough time to react to rotate to A.
              If the Ts manage to take over the site they plant the bomb and now they just have to defend it.
              The second strategy contains slowly killing the enemy team.

    Mid is a central area of Dust2, connecting both bombsites and providing critical map control for both teams.
            It consists of several key positions such as Mid Doors, Xbox and Short.
            Controlling the mid-area is essential to have the most information and to be able to attack from more angles.
            Controlling the mid-area in the beginning is essential for the beginning because it can give you early kills for the T-side. This is possible because of the doors in mid. In order for the CTs to get to B side the have to go there by the doors. this gives an oputrunity for the Ts to get early sniper kills
